# Models Interface Wiki

The `Models` interface plays a crucial role in managing and interacting with models within an Android application, specifically tailored to leverage OpenAI's Chat API. This interface is designed to extend `BaseUseCases<Models>`, focusing on model-specific operations that allow developers to configure model parameters and retrieve information about the models available or details of a specific model. Here's an overview of the `Models` interface and its functionalities.

## Overview

The `Models` interface enriches the application's ability to interact with OpenAI's models by providing methods to list available models and fetch detailed information about a specific model. This interface is an extension of the `BaseUseCases` interface, which means it inherits the ability to fluently configure common parameters across different use cases, with a specialized focus on model-related operations.

## Key Functionalities

### getModels

```kotlin
suspend fun getModels(): Flow<ListModelsResponse>
```

The `getModels` method is responsible for retrieving a list of models available through the OpenAI API. This method is designed as a suspend function, making it compatible with Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous execution. The return type, `Flow<ListModelsResponse>`, indicates that the method provides a stream of responses over time, allowing the application to reactively update the UI or perform other operations as new data becomes available.

**Usage Scenario:** This method is particularly useful when you want to present users with a selection of available models to choose from, or when you need to programmatically assess the capabilities of different models available in the OpenAI API.

### retrieveModel

```kotlin
suspend fun retrieveModel(): Flow<ModelResponse>
```

The `retrieveModel` method allows fetching detailed information about a specific model, based on parameters previously set through the interface's methods inherited from `BaseUseCases`. Similar to `getModels`, this method is a suspend function that returns a `Flow<ModelResponse>`, providing a reactive stream of detailed model information.

**Usage Scenario:** Use this method when you need detailed information about a specific model, such as its capabilities, limitations, or performance characteristics. This can be vital for applications that dynamically select models based on specific criteria or user preferences.

## Conclusion

The `Models` interface is a fundamental part of an architecture that interacts with OpenAI's Chat API, enabling Android applications to dynamically explore and utilize the diverse range of models offered by OpenAI. By providing structured access to model listings and detailed model information, the `Models` interface facilitates sophisticated model management and selection processes within applications, enhancing the overall user experience and the application's intelligence.
